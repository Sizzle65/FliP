This is just a little project I did in IGME-230, also known as Web Design and Implementation. I really enjoyed making this game, and have several ideas on how to improve it to a portfolio piece. These include:

More realistic physics - **Finished** 

Jumping animation - **Finished** 

Better sound effects - **Not Finished** 

End sound effects on screen change - **Not Finished** 

Screen transitions - **Not Finished** 

Reworked non-game screens - **Not Finished (In Progress, Cleaned Up)** 

More levels - **Not Finished** 

Moving platforms - **Not Finished** 

Spikes - **Not Finished** 

Replace the text navigation instructions with buttons - **Finished** 

Timer for speedruns - **Not Finished** 

High score system - **Not Finished** 

Different gamemodes - **Not Finished** 

Tutorial - **Not Finished** 

Story - **Not Finished** 

Other interesting game elements I have yet to think of - **Not Finished**
